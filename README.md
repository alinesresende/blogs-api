  > :information_source: Run the `node` and `db` services with the command `docker-compose up -d --build`.

  - Remember to stop `mysql` if you are using it locally on the default port (`3306`), or adapt it, if you want to use the application in containers;

  - These services will initialize a container named `blogs_api` and another named `blogs_api_db`;

  - From here you can run the `blogs_api` container via CLI or open it in VS Code;

  > :information_source: Use the `docker exec -it blogs_api bash` command.

  - It will give you access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background.
